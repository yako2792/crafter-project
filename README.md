# Crafter: A Universal Project and Framework Generator

## 1. Introduction
Modern software development demands tools that optimize initial setup time, minimize repetitive errors, and enable developers to focus on building essential functionallities. To address this need, I introduce **Crafter**, a tool aiming to become and standard for generating projects and frameworks across different languages and acosystems. This document outlines Crafter's vision, scope, and functionalities, highlighting its relevance in today's landscape.

## 2. Abstract
Crafter is a CLI tool designed to simplify and standardize the creation of projects in popular programming languages and frameworks. Its primary focus is to allow developers to generate project structures with customizable configurations through a set of flexible and user-friendly commands. Initially targeting Python, Crafter plans to expand its support to other languages such as Java, C++, and web ecosystems. This proposal aims to establish Crafter as a benchmark in multi-platform, multi-language tools.

## 3. What is Crafter?
Crafter is a command-line tool (CLI) designed to automate the generation of project structures and frameworks. Its flexibility allows for detailed configurations, such as virtual environment initialization, dependency integration, Git repository creation, and other critical aspects for any project.

### 3.1 State of the Art
Similar tools exist, such as Cookiecutter, mainly oriented toward Python, and Yeoman, focused on the JavaScript ecosystem. However, none comprehensively address support for multiple languages, advanced configurations, and extensive customizations in a single tool. Crafter aims to bridge this gap by offering a broader and more accessible solution.

## 4. Supported Languages

### 4.1 Currently Python Only

At present, Crafter focuses on Python projects, with support for:

* Automatic creation of virtual environments.
* Templates for frameworks like Django and Flask.
* Initialization of basic script or application projects.

In the future, support for languages like Java, C++, C#, and web frameworks such as Bootstrap and Angular is planned.

## 5. Main Features

* **Project Generation:** Create project with well-defined structures.
* **Customizable Configurations:** Use flags to define the project type, include dependencies, initialize Git, among other options.
* **Automated Virtual Environments:** Automatically create and install virtual environments and dependencies.
* **Modular Support:** Templates for various use cases, from simple scripts to complex applications.

## 6. Advantages

1. **Multi-language:** Support for different languages and frameworks in a single CLI.
2. **Flexibility:** Configurations adaptable to project needs.
3. **Time-Saving:** Reduces the time required for initial project setup.
4. **Accessibility:** Intuitive design for developers of all levels.
5. **Scalability:** Modularity that allows functionality to be easily expanded.

## 7. Comparison with Other Tools

| **Feature**             | **Crafter**      | **Cookiecutter** | **Yeoman**       | **Django CLI**   |
|-------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Multi-language**      | Yes              | No               | Yes              | No               |
| **Advanced Customization** | Yes           | Limited          | Yes              | No               |
| **Git Automation**      | Yes              | No               | No               | No               |
| **Modular Support**     | Yes              | Limited          | Yes              | No               |

Crafter stands out for its universal approach and ability to integrate into multiple ecosystems, something other tools do not simultaneously offer.

## 8. Next Development Steps

1. **Expand Language Support:** Incorporate Java, C++, C#, and web frameworks.
2. **Optional Graphical Interface:** Offer a GUI version for users less experienced.
3. **Centralized Template Repository:** Enable the community to share custom templates.

## 9. Conclusion

Crafter has the potential to revolutionize how software projects are initiated, simplifying processes and fostering productivity. Its multi-language focus, flexibility, and modular design position it as a key tool for both individual developers and teams.

Crafter is designed for everyone, and its evolution will depend on the support of a committed community and the backing of those who recognize its market value.
